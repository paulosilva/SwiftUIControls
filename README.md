# Swift UI Custom Controls

On this project I'll put the SwiftUI Custom User Interface (CUI)  controls that I have build for the project aSalvum.

[aSalvum](https://apps.apple.com/pt/app/asalvum/id1574929490?l=en), available on the App Store.

I hope this is useful, So, let's start:

Controls
--------

1. **CUIText**, this control is just like the Text from Apple, but with one minor difference, we can enable a action to copy the content to the clipboard.

2. **CUISecureText**, this control is similar to the Text from Apple, but with two minor difference, we can hide the text with a mask and we can also enable a action to copy the content to the clipboard.

3. **CUITextField**, this will be the next control.

About
--------

I'll publish more controls on this project, so, keep toned.
